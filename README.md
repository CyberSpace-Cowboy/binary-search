# Binary Search

An app to play around with a binary search algorithm. It's implemented in Python and it works inside a terminal/command prompt.

## Run It:

To run this stupid little program you should open the terminal at the same directory as your binary_search.py program, and then type:

```
python binary_search.py
```

### What is a Binary Search Algorithm?
Binary Search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. The main idea behind binary search is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. Like all divide-and-conquer algos, binary search first divides a large array into 2 smaller subarrays and then recursively (or iteratively) operate the subarrays. Binary search reduces the search space to half at each step by taking the middle value and comparing it to the target value and discarding the left or right subarray depending on the comparison.

### Why is Binary Search useful?
- One of the coolest use cases of a sigmoid function is Deep Learning. It's used as an activation function in an artificial neural network. They were inspired by the activation potential in biological neural networks.

- Sigmoid functions are also useful for many machine learning applications where a real number needs to be converted to a probability. A sigmoid function placed as the last layer of a machine learning model can serve to convert the model's output into a probability score, which can be easier to work with and interpret.

- Sigmoid functions are an important part of a logistic regression model. Logistic regression is a modification of linear regression for two-class classification, and converts one or more real-valued inputs into a probability, such as the probability that a customer will purchase a product. The final stage of a logistic regression model is often set to the logistic function, which allows the model to output a probability.
